This is another article for the demo site. I'm writing this article to help with development of my theme. What kind of web developer would I be if I just slapped on the default *minima* package and called it a day?

## My Creative site

My [site](#) should be elegant, simple, and yet, information rich. The breakdown will be as follows:

* Home:  
  About me, nice post list for recent posts
* Archive:  
  Full post list
  * Individual post  
    Post title, content, date, and back link
* My CV:  
  Nice HTML CV with links and images, and link to download PDF

## Some other styles

### Table breakdown:

| Here's | A     | Table   |
|--------|:-----:|--------:|
| *With*   | **some**  | **_content_** |
| [in](#)     | `every` | cell    |

### Blockquotes
